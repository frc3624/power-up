# BEFORE USING
See if the robot has the color sensor or light sensor installed, and then change the variable "USING_COLOR_SENSOR" in the Constants class to the appropriate value

# Controls
This was designed to be used with a Xbox Controller

- Left joystick: Differential drive.
- Y axis of right joystick: Controls ladder.
- Right bumper: Toggle gear between high gear and low gear.
- Left trigger: Will prepare the intake to collect a cube by opening the arms and spinning the intake wheels in.
- Right trigger: Will spin the intake wheels out in order to eject a cube.
- DPad down and up can be used to adjust a held cube, moving it in and out respectively.
- X button: Fold and unfold the robot

I added functionality to give the driver manual control over the folding mechanism in case there is an error with folding and for the climbing phase.

- A button: Toggles the lock
