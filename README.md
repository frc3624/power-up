# Power Up (Archived)

The code for 2018's Power Up is now archived. This robot has been disassembled and no longer exists. Power Up was our
first robot to go to championships, and would be followed by Deep Space, which went to championships as well.

This robot's legacy amongst the team was always that it was a horrifically janky robot in regards to its reliability.
It arguably looks the coolest/most complex, but it paid the the price for that in its usability. Due to its horribly
front heavy design, it would constantly tip forwards, and its chain lift and cube intake system were finnicky to program
at best. Nevertheless, this robot performed well enough at regionals to make championships, so it's obviously not all
bad. The lessons learned from the robot are pretty apparent, and hopefully we won't make the same mistakes again.

# Controls
This was designed to be used with a Xbox Controller

- Left joystick: Differential drive.
- Y axis of right joystick: Controls ladder.
- Right bumper: Toggle gear between high gear and low gear.
- Left trigger: Will prepare the intake to collect a cube by opening the arms and spinning the intake wheels in.
- Right trigger: Will spin the intake wheels out in order to eject a cube.
- DPad down and up can be used to adjust a held cube, moving it in and out respectively.
- X button: Fold and unfold the robot

I added functionality to give the driver manual control over the folding mechanism in case there is an error with folding and for the climbing phase.

- A button: Toggles the lock
- B button: Pulls the chain lift back
