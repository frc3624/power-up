 * I made this command because I want something a lot more reliable than "If I start at the bottom
 * and set the speed of the chain lift to .6 for 1 second, it will go to the height I want"
 * This command will also be a demonstration on how to make your own PID controller.
 * http://robotsforroboticists.com/pid-control/
 * I like this resource because not only does it tell you what a PID is in a simple way, but
 * it also tells you how to do it in code.
